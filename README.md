# MY V-SERVER-SETUP OR HOW TO SET UP A VM

## What is a VM?  
Long story short - A VM or Virtual Machine is a software program that runs on a 
physical server and emulates it. A VM can run an operating system and applications as if they were running on real hardware.
A software environment called Hypervisor creates and manages the VMs.
